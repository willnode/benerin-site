### $\textcolor{red}{\textsf{Benerin}}\textcolor{green}{\textsf{.CO}}$ 

Benerin.CO is an early project about spell checking and proofing for Indonesian Languages. Basically it works like Grammarly, but for Indonesian.

This is a repository for public site (the frontend) of benerin.co. Source code for api.benerin.co is currently not open.

This project is still in very early stage. There's no specific deadline when it will become fully functional.

We would like to hear your opinion about this project! You're welcome to up for a discussion. We aim to make it available for everyone especially students and teachers in academic institutions.
